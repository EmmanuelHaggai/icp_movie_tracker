# ICP_Movie_Tracker
This is an Azle smart contract that can help you keep track of the diffrent movies that you are watching and also your personal ratings of them. This is just a simple prototype version but the plan is to incorporate advanced Web 3 features such as Artificial Intelligence(AI), Natural Language Processing(NLP) and Machine Learning(ML) to create an inteligent dApp that can tell you exactly what you'll like and where you can watch it.
