# ICP_Movie_Tracker
This is an Azle smart contract that can help you keep track of the diffrent movies that you are watching and also your personal ratings of them. This is just a simple prototype version but the plan is to incorporate advanced Web 3 features such as Artificial Intelligence(AI), Natural Language Processing(NLP) and Machine Learning(ML) to create an inteligent dApp that can tell you exactly what you'll like and where you can watch it.


## Getting Started

1. Let's start by installing the project's dependencies
```bash 
npm install
```
2. Make sure that you have the Node Version Manager (nvm) installed. If not, use the following command on your terminal.
```bash 
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```
3. Switch to Node.js version 18:>
```bash 
 nvm use 18
 ```
4. Make sure that you have DFX installed, if not, install from here [installation](https://demergent-labs.github.io/azle/installation.html).
5. Reload your terminal
6. Run the command below to get dfx started.
```bash 
dfx start --background
```
4. Run `dfx deploy` to deploy the code(The first time takes several minutes so please be patient).
```bash

```
5. You can now interact with it using the dfx cli or the web interface(link will be visible after deployment).
